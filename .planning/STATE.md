# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Generate and publish complete social media posts (single, carousel, or story) in one wizard run, with AI-generated images, WhatsApp preview, SI approval, and automatic publishing to Instagram + Facebook
**Current focus:** v1.2 Stories Publishing — Phase 10 ready to plan

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.2 Stories Publishing
Phase: 10 — Wizard Historia Format
Plan: Not started
Status: Roadmap complete — ready for `/gsd:plan-phase 10`
Last activity: 2026-04-18 — Roadmap for v1.2 created (Phases 10-13)

Progress: [██████████] 100% (v1.0) — [██████████] 100% (v1.1) — [░░░░░░░░░░] 0% (v1.2)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1.0):**
- Plans: 7 | Timeline: 2026-04-03 → 2026-04-06 (3 days)

**Velocity (v1.1):**
- Plans: 14 | Commits: 74 | Timeline: 2026-04-10 → 2026-04-17 (7 days)

## Accumulated Context

### Open Items

- **instagram_manage_comments scope:** Must be added to Facebook App; Susana regenerates Meta token. Until then, hashtag comments fail with code 10 (post still publishes, error handler fires WA alert).
- **Meta token lifetime:** Depends on Susana maintaining admin role on Propulsar AI Facebook page.
- **Azure SAS expiry:** 2027-04-10 — renew before that date.
- **Supabase session status:** Never set to "consumed" after publish — accepted as low-risk tech debt.

### v1.2 Research Flags (resolved in roadmap)

- **IG Story host conflict:** `graph.instagram.com` vs `graph.facebook.com` — IGSTORY-02 requires a live API test as the first task of Phase 12 to resolve before any production node is built.
- **FB Story flow conflict:** Single-step vs 2-step — FBSTORY-01 requires a live API test as the first task of Phase 13 to resolve before any production node is built.
- **ERR-01 scope:** Covers wiring `onError` for IG Story nodes (Phase 12) and FB Story nodes (Phase 13) into the existing 9-node error handler subgraph — no changes to subgraph logic.
